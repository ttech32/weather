This program is used to check the weather forecast of whatever location you put, I used the API of openweathermap.
To use it enter the city "Abuja".
Next is to enter the Country's Code "NG" that's for Nigeria
Then it will give you the necessary details you need.
I coded this using Rust Programming Language.
